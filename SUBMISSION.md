## Implementation Overview

You need to include a few sentences that provide an overview of your implementation in this section.

## Reflecton

1. What do you think was the motivation behind assigning this project in this class?

   To provide a better understanding of the filesystem at a low level.

1. What is the most important thing you learned in this project?

   That i should have started earlier.

1. What do you wish you had spent more time on or done differently?

   Probably should have spent more time on `write`.

1. What part of the project did you do your best work on?

   The parts where there is dynamic allocation. There are no memory leaks.

1. What was the most enjoyable part of this project?

   I liked testing it and seeing it all come together.

1. What was the least enjoyable part of this project?

   Having to think so hard about how things are laid out in memory and on the disk.

1. How could your instructor change this project to make it better next time?

   Would have liked >2 weeks to work on this. Also would have been helpful to include 
   examples of how other filesystems are implemented. Would have preferred if point
   distribution was more proportional to the time I spent on each of the methods.
   Some methods depended on others to be able to test, and were thus more important,
   but still worth the same number of points.
